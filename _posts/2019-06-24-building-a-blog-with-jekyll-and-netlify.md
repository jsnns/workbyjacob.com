This blog you’re reading right now is powered for free by Netlify and Jekyll. I’ve spent most of my years in the wonderful world of React. I scoffed at the idea of static site generators… until I used Jekyll and Netlify for the first time.

I've spent time managing a Wordpress site and honestly never want to be near one again. Wordpress takes your focus away from creating content. I don't really want to spend time managing plugin hell do you? 

## Enter Jekyll
Jekyll is a static site generator, it lets you define layouts and templates and then imports your content from Markdown files. Combine that with a content management system from Netlify and you have a free personal blog.

> Imagine if Wordpress was built for users.

If you've ever managed your own servers, then the toils of patching and maintenance keep you up at night. For my personal site, I want to sleep easy, without fear that my site is vulnerable or down.

The combination of Netlify, Netlify CMS, and Jekyll have given me the freedom to run a personal site and focus on the content.
