This blog you’re reading right now is powered for free by Netlify and Jekyll. I’ve been raised in the era of React thus I scoffed at the idea of static site generators… until I used Jekyll and Netlify for the first time.

In the early days of my career, I spent time managing multiple Wordpress sites and honestly never got the change to focus on the content I was trying to create. Plugin hell anyone? Jekyll is a static site generator, it lets you define layouts and templates and then imports your content from Markdown files.

If you've ever managed your own host, then you know the toils of patching and upgrading. For my personal site, I want to sleep at night knowing that nothing can happen that will cost me hours in the morning.

The combination of Netlify, Netlify CMS, and Jekyll have let me run a personal site without having to think about it.
