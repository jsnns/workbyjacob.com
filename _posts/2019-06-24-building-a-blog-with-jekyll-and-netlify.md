his blog you're reading right now is powered for free by Netlify and Jekyll. I've spent most of my years in the beautiful world of React. I scoffed at the idea of static site generators until I used Jekyll and Netlify for the first time.

I've spent time managing a Wordpress site and honestly never want to be near one again. Wordpress takes your focus away from creating content. As an engineer, I don't care to spend my time managing plugin hell, do you?

## Enter Jekyll

Jekyll is a static site generator; it lets you define layouts and templates and imports your content from Markdown files. It builds your content and layouts into a static HTML site; static sites are typically free to host. Combine that with a content management system from Netlify, and you have a free personal blog.

> Netlify and Jekyll are what Wordpress wants to be as an adult.

If you've ever managed servers, then the toils of patching and maintenance keep you up at night. For my site, I want to sleep easy, without fear that my site is vulnerable or down.

The combination of Netlify, Netlify CMS, and Jekyll have given me the freedom to run a personal site and focus on the content.
