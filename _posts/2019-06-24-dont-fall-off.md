I got clips on Friday.. while I was learning to use them my coach told me falling the ground was inevitable… less than 24 hours later I was in the ER. It’s true I fell but having bike clips likely made my trip to the ER significantly less painful.

On one side of the sidewalk was a set of large *boulders* I’m quite glad I happened to fall on the pavement. I whole heartedly believe the clips kept me with the bike and away from the boulders. Regardless, I’m trying to without glasses or functioning depth perception, let’s just say Rust is not very accessible to the blind… maybe they should work on that.
