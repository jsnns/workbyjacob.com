Smaller towns tend to have a hard time attracting and retaining technical talent. The lure of large cities can make it harder for young companies to attract talent in smaller towns. For one, the options provided by large cities are numerous from events to mass transit options metropolises offer a diverse set of lifestyle choices that are difficult for a small town to provide.

To make yourself attractive to city-dwelling top talent, you have to create a flexible and exciting atmosphere that they have come to expect. City dwellers enjoy more diverse lifestyle choices than their small town counterparts; transportation choices are commonly one of the top amenities.

Gone are the days where every family drives to work; many young professionals are choosing mass transit, biking, or walking instead of owning and maintaining a car[1]. For young professionals, smaller cities often lack the transportation infrastructure to facilitate the flexible life they want to live.  In martial arts, it's incredibly powerful to use your attacker's weight against them; likewise, it's possible to use the lure of a big city to attract technical talent to your business.

## Encourage long-term remote work
Building infrastructure can be expensive, and while it's generally worth it for a city, any single small business would have an impossible time building transportation infrastructure. There are much more cost-effective ways to bring the benefit of diverse commute options to your employees. It's much easier to piggyback on the existing flexibility of big cities by establishing a remote-work policy.

When employees are provided the flexibility to work wherever they want, you don't have to compete with the options offered by big cities. However, a remote workforce is not always possible. If you don't like the idea of a remote workforce, there are ways to provide commute opportunities that won't break the bank.

## Create a company bus route
If you want to expand the number of transport opportunities for your employees, there are several approaches. If you have a cluster of employees in a nearby suburb or neighborhood, explore creating a bus route to pick up your employees and drop them at your office. A bus route will transform a dull commute to one filled with opportunities for conversation with colleagues.

## Start a 'bike to work' club
Cycling to work has seen a dramatic rise in popularity in the last decade[2]. In addition to the numerous health benefits cycling to work is also much cheaper than owning and maintaining a car. If your population of employees lives close to your office a 'bike to work' club could help facilitate the healthy and cost-effective commute option. In addition to forming a group of riders, it's essential to distribute resources on convenient biking trails and area-specific tips.

In the era of the big city, it's not impossible for businesses in small towns to attract and retain talent.
