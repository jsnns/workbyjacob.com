Come with me on my journey to crack the nut of personal finance. My first lesson- learning how to manage the money you have is far more important than making more. Personal finance isn't just for aspiring millionaires, it's for anyone who wants to build their life on a solid foundation. Having an understanding of your personal finances frees you to build the life you want.

Over the course of my journey, I've stubbed my toe many times. I've made tons of mistakes and reflected on my mishaps time and time again. Through my toils, I've realized that personal finance requires you to hear logic over your emotions a majority of the time. Due to my background in Information Technology; it didn't me very long try and pass off this task to a computer.

Out of the many responsibilities in life perhaps none is more impactful than personal finance. As kids, we are taught many skills and trades, yet somehow money management is largely untouched. Contrary to school curriculums, personal finance is an area of life that is certainly worth learning. Personal finance is a skill that demands both skillful planning and consistent high-quality execution. If you make a great plan but fail to control your impulses, you're unlikely to succeed.

As it happens, most of us are quite poor at being logical and meticulous, especially in emotionally charged situations. We've all been him- imagine the gleeful consumer stalking the TVs at BestBuy, he's planned to spend $500 on a new TV for his living room. The store associate walks over and shows him a dazzling new TV with a few more bells and whistles- it's only $250 more. Since "it's going to last for a while" He gets home with his new TV and realizes yet again, he followed his emotions and not his plan. Managing our money is made more difficult by a world designed to extract money from every one of us.

As soon as I realized the deck was stacked against me, I began to look for another solution to my money management problems. One such solution would employ computers to make my decisions for me. I could write down my decision-making criteria and give let the computer make the decisions for me. This had significant upsides- for one, computers lack emotion, making them less vulnerable to the effects of advertising.

After recording my decision-making criteria, I had enough logic to get started translating my thoughts into algorithms that would power my financial future.
One day while I was sitting at the mall I realized I needed new shoes - I got out my computer and asked if I should buy the new shoes. Quickly I knew that buying the shoes was a good idea, my current ones had lasted a very long time and the ones I wanted were on clearance. Without the algorithms, I wouldn't have bought the shoes, I would have felt guilty and kept going on about my life, spending the money on 99¢ apps instead. The algorithm knew that shoes were a necessity and encouraged me to buy them at a discount.

In the last three months, my algorithms have made about 70 different decisions, in that time I've seen my savings rate increase by about 25%. Through next year, I want most of the decisions I make to be influenced deeply by algorithms.
