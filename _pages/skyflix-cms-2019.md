A Cabin Management System or CMS is a set of hardware and software devices that allow passengers of Aircraft to control the environment, including A/V equipment, lighting, and climate. I designed and built the software and hardware integration for Switch CMS with an independent team, including another hardware engineer and me.

Switch is a replacement for the expensive CMS solutions offered by large organizations like Honeywell. Switch provides quick and easy access to the existing features an Aircraft's cabin. Switch places commonly used controls within reach through our mobile app.

Switch CMS can control many devices, including...

* **Lighting\*\*, with everyday operations like *all* lights on or off. Switch supports multiple lights in discrete regions such as _Galley_, _Forward_, and _Aft_

* **Climate**, with support for multiple zones

* **Audio**, and video with support for numerous audio and video devices in various zones.

## Technology

Given the importance of reusing existing devices, I built Switch CMS to control existing Aircraft components through Serial and IR connections. Given the constraints of the environment in which this product operates, I reinforced the joints between hardware and software with redundant fail-over systems.
